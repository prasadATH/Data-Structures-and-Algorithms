The table shows time records of 3 sorting methods tested using
4 different types for 4 different array sizes. The 3 sorting techniques
 tested are Bubble sort, Insertion sort and selection sort in which bubble
 sort uses the method of comparing adjacent pairs and swapping them if
 they are not in order, insertion sort checks each element and adds it to the 
correct place comparing values in either sides and selection sort
Select smallest item and swap it with the necessary item to build the sorted array.

When the time Complexity of bubble sort and insertion sort is considered they show O(N) 
Complexity in the best case and O(N2) Complexity in average and worst cases But Insertion
sort is considered to be better due lessser number of swaps unlike bubble sort.
Time complexity of selection sort in best, average and worst case is given as O(N2) 
since it has equal number of passes in all 3 cases.

In the table of records, a common feature of time increment is seen with increase of 
the array size.It is crystal clear that insertion sort uses lesser amount of 
time in sorting the data in all the four cases ascending, descending, random order
and nearly sorted, and With lesser amount of data it is nearly 4% to 5% of the time used 
by other sorting methods.But Ascending type consumes significantly lower values compared 
to all the time durations in the shown records. An average of five readings were obtained for each value of the
shown table and from it insertion sort showed solid stable values in each attempt than
 other two methods.

Generally the time used to sort the array in Ascending order, descending order,
 random order and nearly sorted is lesser in selection sorting method that bubble sort method.
Bubble sorting method uses lesser time in Ascending  and nearly sorted methods than other 
the other two types(descending order and random order).
